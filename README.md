Sample use cases: Intel SGX, AMD SEV

isolation + attestation

"tamper resistant processing environment that runs on a separation
kernel

guarantees the authenticity of the executed code, the
integrity of the runtime states (e.g. CPU registers, memory
and sensitive I/O), and the confidentiality of its code, data
and runtime states stored on a persistent memory

must be able to provide remote attestation that proves its
trustworthiness for third-parties"
